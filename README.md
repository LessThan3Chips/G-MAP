G-MAP will be an earthquake fault mapping and/or shakemap generator using TurboWarp to further help people new to seismology understand about faulting. 

This will include:
1. A customisable area for settings.
2. An operational shakemap generator (which also is interactable)
3. Extra information for faulting and geological information
4. Simplified real-life information for extra precision

My hope for releasing this is by early-mid may. (First Version)
